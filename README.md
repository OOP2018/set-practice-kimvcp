Answer the questions in the exercises here. Push your answer and code to Github Classroom.

* When you print elements in the set, are they in same order as you added them?
	= No, the data will be random.
	
* what is the command to remove all elements from a `set`?
	- set.clear()
	
* When you add elements in a different order and print them, did the order change?
	- Yes it does
	
* Can you add a duplicate "cat" and "dog" to set?
	- No, the duplicate data can't be added.
	
* What is the result when you use TreeSet instead of HashSet?
	- TreeSet will sort the data by alphabets but HashSet won't sort any data.
	
* Could we make `setExplorer` work with either Set or List?  How?
	- Yes, we change the parameter to "Collection<String> @param name" ,so it will be able to use different set. Set and List are also the types of Collection.
